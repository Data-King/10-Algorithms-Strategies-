10 Trading Algos-
Trading algorithms and backtesting are essential components of quantitative trading. Hereâ€™s an overview of ten popular trading algorithms and methods for backtesting them using Python. Each algorithm is followed by a basic example of how you might implement it using libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and backtrader.



Summary
1. Moving Average Crossover: Identifies buy/sell signals based on moving average crossovers.
2. Relative Strength Index (RSI): Measures overbought/oversold conditions.
3. Bollinger Bands: Uses volatility to identify trading opportunities.
4. Momentum Trading: Trades based on the momentum of price movements.
5. Mean Reversion: Assumes prices will revert to their mean.
6. MACD: Tracks trends and momentum through moving averages.
7. Pair Trading: Exploits price differences between correlated assets.
8. Arbitrage: Exploits price differences between similar assets.
9. Backtrader Example: Implements a moving average crossover strategy with the Backtrader library.
10.M ean Reversion with Backtrader: Implements a mean reversion strategy with the Backtrader library.



These examples illustrate fundamental trading strategies and how to use Python for backtesting and analyzing trading algorithms.
